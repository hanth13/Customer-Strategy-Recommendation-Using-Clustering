This report analyzed 500 observations using Cluster Analysis to enhance loan portfolio management for Lending Club. The goal was to segment borrowers into distinct groups based on risk and economic benefits, enabling tailored product offerings, optimized marketing, and improved customer service. The methodology included variable selection, outlier treatment, and Factor Analysis to address multicollinearity. Using hierarchical and K-means clustering, four borrower clusters were identified, each with different risk and return profiles. The analysis highlighted the need for LC to address high-risk, low-return segments and capitalize on more profitable and growth-oriented customer groups.
